1..] Write a program to read 100 integers, find their average and determine by how each integer deviates from that average. (Page 27)
2..] Write a program to find length of a string strlen().
3..] Write a program to return the position of string location of the first occurence of the seond string parameter within the first parameter of the string (page 33)
4..] Write a program to implement strcat(char *s1, char *s2) (page 34)
5..] Write a program to implement substr(char *s1, char *s2) (page 34)
6..] Write the formula to access a 2 dimensional array.
7..] Implement a union.

8..] Write a C function listoff that accepts two one-dimensional array parameters of the same size: range and sub. range represents 
the range of an integer array. For example if the elements of range are
	3  5  10  6  3
range represents an array a declared by
	int a[3][5][10][6][3]
The elements of sub represent subscripts of the foregoing array. If sub[i] does not lie between 0 and range[i]-1, all subscripts from the
ith onwards are missing. In the foregoing example if the elements of sub are
	1 3 1 2 3
sub represents the one-dimensional array a[1][3][1][2]. The function listoff should print the offsets from the based of the array a 
represented by range of all the elements of a that are included in the array (or the offset of the single element if all subscripts are
within bounds) represented by sub. Assume that the size(esize) of each element of a is 1. In the foregoing example listoff would print 
the values 4,5 and 6

9..] Write a function to reduce the rational number using euclid's algorithm, function to determin whether 2 rational numbers are equal, function to multiply 2 rational numbers. Euclid's algorithm is below :

1. Let a be the larger of the numerator and denominator and let b be the smaller.
2. Divide b in to a, finding a quotient q and a remainder r.
3. Set a = b and b = r.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until b is 0.
5. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by the value of a.

10..]
